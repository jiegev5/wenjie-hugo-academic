However, the effectiveness of DNNs relies on the availability of large, labeled data to uncover useful feature representations. The widespread use of DNN models in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and voice sensing can be attributed to the massively available labeled training datasets. Despite the abundance of IoT sensing data, the human-uninterpretable property of AIoT data makes it difficult to construct labeled datasets for DNN model training. Additionally, variations in sensor hardware or DNN models' deployment environments introduce domain shifts, making generalized machine learning algorithms even more difficult to develop. The scarcity of labeled training data and run-time domain shifts are two main challenges in developing effective machine learning algorithms for AIoT sensing. The goal of my research is to address the above challenges for AIoT sensing applications. Two main research methodologies are involved. The first is to leverage the latest state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to develop effective models for smart sensing. The second approach involves integrating known prior knowledge into machine learning algorithms to develop more accurate and reliable DNN models for AIoT sensing applications.","tags":["Conference papers"],"title":"PhD Forum Abstract: Integrating Prior Knowledge and Machine Learning Techniques for Efficient AIoT Sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenjie Luo","Rui Tan"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1679443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679443200,"objectID":"19b4e8fdd0fde233e41ad68dc12c1b4b","permalink":"http://www.wenjieluo.xyz/publication/workshop-dicps/","publishdate":"2023-03-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/workshop-dicps/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent advances in machine learning inspire the development of deep neural network-based smart sensing applications for the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT).

The existing solutions rely on data-driven approaches and do not consider the physical laws that govern data generation or domain shifts. This paper discusses the potential of utilizing the known physical laws to improve the machine learning model generalizability for AIoT applications. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that physics-informed machine learning can (1) effectively assist the generalization of deep neural networks and (2) achieve better performance compared with conventional approaches.

The current solutions based on inertial, radio frequency, and geomagnetic sensing may have degraded performance when their limiting factors take effect. In this paper, we present a new indoor simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system that utilizes the smartphone's built-in audio hardware and inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our system uses a smartphone's loudspeaker to emit near-inaudible chirps and then the microphone to record the acoustic echoes from the indoor environment. Our profiling measurements show that the echoes carry location information with sub-meter granularity. To enable SLAM, we apply contrastive learning to construct an echoic location feature (ELF) extractor, such that the loop closures on the smartphone's trajectory can be accurately detected from the associated ELF trace. The detection results effectively regulate the IMU-based trajectory reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our ELF-based SLAM achieves median localization errors of 0.1m, 0.53m, and 0.4m on the reconstructed trajectories in a living room, an office, and a shopping mall, and outperforms the Wi-Fi and geomagnetic SLAM systems.","tags":["Conference papers"],"title":"Indoor Smartphone SLAM with Learned Echoic Location Features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qun Song","Zhenyu Yan","Wenjie Luo","Rui Tan"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1665014400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665014400,"objectID":"bac4015eb02435affc527684c8434ba4","permalink":"http://www.wenjieluo.xyz/publication/conf-sardino/","publishdate":"2022-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-sardino/","section":"publication","summary":"Adversarial example attack endangers the mobile edge systems such as vehicles and drones that adopt deep neural networks for visual sensing. This paper presents **Sardino**, an active and dynamic defense approach that renews the inference ensemble at run time to develop security against the adaptive adversary who tries to exfiltrate the ensemble and construct the corresponding effective adversarial examples. By applying consistency check and data fusion on the ensemble's predictions, Sardino can detect and thwart adversarial inputs. Compared with the training-based ensemble renewal, we use HyperNet to achieve *one million times* acceleration and per-frame ensemble renewal that presents the highest level of difficulty to the prerequisite exfiltration attacks. We design a run-time planner that maximizes the ensemble size in favor of security while maintaining the processing frame rate. Beyond adversarial examples, Sardino can also address the issue of out-of-distribution inputs effectively. This paper presents extensive evaluation of Sardino's performance in counteracting adversarial examples and applies it to build a real-time car-borne traffic sign recognition system.

For various applications, it is desirable to localize LoRaWAN devices based on their uplink frames that convey application data. This localization service operates in an unobtrusive manner, in that it requires no special software instrumentation to the LoRaWAN devices. This paper investigates the feasibility of unobtrusive localization for LoRaWAN devices in hall-size indoor spaces like warehouses, airport terminals, sports centers, museum halls, etc. We study the TDoA-based approach, which needs to address two challenges of poor timing performance of LoRaWAN narrowband signal and nanosecond-level clock synchronization among anchors. We propose the ILLOC system featuring two LoRaWAN-specific techniques (1) the cross-correlation among the differential phase sequences received by two anchors to estimate TDoA and (2) the just-in-time synchronization enabled by a specially deployed LoRaWAN end device providing time reference upon detecting a target device’s transmission. In a long tunnel corridor, a 70 × 32 m2 sports hall, and a 110 × 70 m2 indoor plaza with extensive non-line-of-sight propagation paths, ILLOC achieves median localization errors of 6 m (with 2 anchors), 8.36 m (with 6 anchors), and 15.16 m (with 6 anchors and frame fusion), respectively. The achieved accuracy makes ILLOC useful for applications including zone-level asset tracking, misplacement detection airport trolley management, and cybersecurity enforcement like detecting impersonation attacks launched by remote radios.","tags":["Journal articles"],"title":"ILLOC: In-Hall Localization with Standard LoRaWAN Uplink Frames","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Run-time domain shifts from training-phase domains are common in sensing systems designed with deep learning.

You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

We are generous and willing to give a hand to others when social norms take effect. However, when market norms enter our consideration, the social norms depart. Example: we are so willingly to help others for FREE while resist to reach out if we are PAID to do these things! When a social norm collides with market norm, social norm goes away for long time. In other words, social relationships are not easy to reestablish. Once the bloom is off the rose, once a social norm istrumped by a market norm, it rarely return Today, companies are trying to create social norms with employees and customers. Social rewards strongly motivate behavior, and one of the least used in corporate life is the encouragement of social rewards and reputation. How much work If corporations started thinking in terms of social norms, they would realize that these norms build loyalty and, more important, make people want to extend themselves to the degree that corporations need today: to be flexible, concerned, and willing to pitch in. That’s what a social relationshop delivers.- Money, as it turns out, is very often the most expensive way to motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper, but oftern more effective as well. Chapter 6: Influence of arousal Looking from one emotional state to another is impossible. We cannot predict what will be our reactions in passionate state (e.g., sexual arousal) when we are calm enough. It is essential to learn to bridge this gap in making decisions of our lives. We need to explore two sides of ourselves; we need to see how the gap between the hot and cold states benefits our lives, and where it leads us astray. Chapter 7: The problem of procrastination and self-control Giving up on our long-term goals for immediate gratification, my firiends, is procrastination. Resisting temptation and instilling self-control are our general goals. Repeatedly failing to achieve them is a source of much of our misery. A dictatorial treatment on us is a good choice to combat procrastination. Simplification is one mark of real genius.
