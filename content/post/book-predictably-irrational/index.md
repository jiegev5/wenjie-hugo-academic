## The Cost of Social Norms

**We are happy to do things, but not when we are paird to do them**

1. We live in a world where two norms co-exist: social norms and market norms. We are generous and willing to give a hand to others when social norms take effect. However, when market norms enter our consideration, the social norms depart. Example: we are so willingly to help others for **FREE** while resist to reach out if we are **paid** to do these things!
