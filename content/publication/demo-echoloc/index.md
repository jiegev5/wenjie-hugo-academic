abstract: Smartphone indoor location awareness is increasingly demanded by a variety of mobile applications. The existing solutions for accurate smartphone indoor localization rely on additional devices or pre-installed infrastructure (e.g., dense WiFi access points, Bluetooth beacons). In this demo, we present EchoLoc, an infrastructure-free smartphone indoor localization system using room acoustic response to a chirp emitted by the phone. EchoLoc consists of a mobile client for echo data collection and a cloud server hosting a deep neural network for location inference. EchoLoc achieves 95% accuracy in recognizing 101 locations in a large public indoor space and a median localization error of 0.5m in a typical lab area.
