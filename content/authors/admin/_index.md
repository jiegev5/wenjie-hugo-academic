I am a 4th year full-time PhD student at School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx). My supervisor is Prof [Tan Rui](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/tanrui/). My research interest is exploiting physical knowledge into AIoT. Specifically, I exploit the first principles, together with state-of-the-art machine learning to address the challenges of data scarcity, labeling or the domain shifts in AIoT applications. You can find more about our researches at [NTU IoT Sensing Group website](https://ntuiot.xyz/).

I obtained the bachelor's degree from School of Electrical and Electronic of Engineering with 2nd upper degree in 2015 at Nanyang Technological University. Thereafter, I spent four years at [Micron Technology, Singapore](https://www.micron.com/) prior starting my PhD degree. I really appreciate about this journey, Micron colleagues are very nice and I've had unforgetful memories there.

<!-- % From 2015 to 2018, I worked as a product engineer at MSB, where the scope is developing Functional Development Verification (FDV) test for [Micron 3D NAND products](https://www.micron.com/products/nand-flash). I joined Yield Enhancement team at Fab10N in August of 2018, where I worked as a Electrical Failure Analysis (EFA). The new job scope is to perform wafer-level electrical failure analysis for NAND products. -->
